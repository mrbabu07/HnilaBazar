                    ⚠️  YOUR SERVER MUST BE RESTARTED  ⚠️
================================================================================

YOU ARE GETTING 404 ERRORS BECAUSE YOUR SERVER IS RUNNING OLD CODE!

The fix is complete. Mongoose is installed. The code is ready.
You just need to RESTART THE SERVER!

================================================================================
                         EASIEST METHOD - DO THIS:
================================================================================

1. Double-click this file: FORCE_RESTART.bat

2. Watch for these messages:
   ✅ Mongoose connected successfully
   ✅ Offers routes registered

3. If you see those messages, YOU'RE DONE! ✅

4. Test by going to: http://localhost:5173/admin/offers

================================================================================
                      ALTERNATIVE METHOD (If above fails):
================================================================================

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell

2. Run these commands:
   
   taskkill /F /IM node.exe
   cd Server
   node index.js

3. Watch for the success messages above

================================================================================
                            HOW TO VERIFY IT WORKS:
================================================================================

After restart, open browser and go to:

http://localhost:5000/api/test-mongoose

You should see:
{
  "message": "Server is running NEW code with Mongoose!",
  "mongooseConnected": true,
  "timestamp": "..."
}

If you see that, the server is fixed! ✅

Then go to: http://localhost:5173/admin/offers
Click "Create Offer" and it will work!

================================================================================
                              WHAT'S HAPPENING:
================================================================================

Your server is currently running OLD code (before I added Mongoose).
Even though I:
  ✅ Installed mongoose package
  ✅ Added mongoose connection to server code
  ✅ Fixed all the routes

The server needs to be RESTARTED to load the new code!

It's like editing a Word document but not saving it - the changes exist
but aren't being used until you restart.

================================================================================
                                 SUMMARY:
================================================================================

1. Double-click: FORCE_RESTART.bat
2. Look for: "Mongoose connected successfully"
3. Test: http://localhost:5173/admin/offers
4. Create an offer - it will work! ✅

That's it! The fix is complete. Just restart!
